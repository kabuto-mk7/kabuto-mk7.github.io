      <p>Hey there! welcome to my first entry. Thought i'd explain what this is all about and what the point of this all is! </p>
      <p>In short, I wanted a place where I can write down my thoughts as they occur, keep track of my day to day life as well as record a sort of history of everything. A big part of this for me is also making it published online. I doubt anyone will ever read any of this, but I wanted to have a semi-public place as it will give me more of a legitimate reason to hold my self to acomplish what I want to do. I've often found diary writing in physical journals to either become forgotten about or to feel like I can't be honest with myself about what I actually want to do. So I hope this can be a better place for me!</p>
