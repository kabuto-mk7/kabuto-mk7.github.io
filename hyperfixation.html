<p>So I've never been diagnosed but im pretty sure I have some traits of either asd or ADHD, there's a lot of reasons for this but one of which is my hyperfixations.</p>

<p>over time i tend to pick up new things and become obsessed with them, it becomes everything i think about from when i wake up to when i got to sleep, it becomes everything i care about until eventually it just loses all value to me. It's a blessing and a curse, it means i get really good and really knowledgable about a lot of varied and different things, but it also means i can never stick to one thing to the point of complete mastery.</p>
  
<p>I thought i'd give myself a page like this so i can track whatever my current hyperfixation is, as well as when i transition to and from new ones.</p>
