<p>Hi, i'm Kemal and i really like computers and niche internet culture. I made this site so i can have somewhere to write and post things every now and then. I also really wanted to use this as a place to host any projects or resources.</p>

<p>here's some random stuff about me:</p>
  
<p>I've competed in a lot of different e-sports over the years, competitive gaming has always been one of my favourite hobbies. I'm not really sure why, I think it's because I like how you can really feel improvement being made. To be honest I just really like learning things and achieving things that I consider difficult.</p>
 
<p>I graduated with a 1st class honours degree for computer science. It was extremely fun and I hope to complete a masters degree at some point.</p>

<p>I'm working as a video editor for a couple youtubers, i really do enjoy creative things, but I hope to use my degree to find a long term job within computer science, hopefully software development. I was previously working at a company that was making a mobile music app but i decided to part ways with them.</p>
  
<p>I really want to travel more and I'm aiming on going to both korea and japan as soon as possible!</p>
